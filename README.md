barber booking app using Flutter + Firebase 
### description ##
hello people, this is an app I have been working on recently for a friend of mine to practice and improve myself and my skills 
my friend told me about the features that he wants in the app, I have done most of what he has asked me to do which was a bit challenging 
I have done it using Flutter and Firebase

there is a release tag if you want to try the app out 
here are screenshots
